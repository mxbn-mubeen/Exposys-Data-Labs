NAME OF THE PROJECT: Daibetes Prediction


To predict diabetes using machine learning, we start by collecting and preparing a dataset with health data and diabetes status. We then split this data into two parts for training and testing. Next, we choose a classification method, like Logistic Regression, to build a model on the training data. After training, we assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and precision on the test data.This model can later be used to predict diabetes risk for new individuals, aiding in early detection.
